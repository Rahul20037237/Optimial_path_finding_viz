# DFS, BFS, and A* Pathfinding Visualization using Pygame

Welcome to the **Pathfinding Visualization** project! This project provides a visual representation of popular pathfinding algorithms such as **DFS (Depth First Search)**, **BFS (Breadth First Search)**, and ****A* (A-Star)**** using Python and the Pygame library.

## üöÄ Features
- **Grid-based visualization** of pathfinding algorithms.
- **Interactive animations** for DFS and BFS algorithms.
- **Real-time control** using keyboard for starting and resetting the algorithm.

## üìã Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pygame library**

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow these simple steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahul20037237/Optimial_path_finding_viz.git
   cd Optimial_path_finding_viz
